## FSND Project 2: Tournament Pairings

### Usage:

In order to first create the database and its schema, execute the following commands from your system's command line:

`$ psql -f tournament.sql`

To test functions, run:

`$ python tournament_test.py`


### Extra Credit:

use:

`$ psql -f tournament_xtra.sql`

To test functions, run:

`$ python test_xtra.py`

Code accouting for odd number of players and to allow byes included in *tourn_xtra.py* and
*tournament_xtra.sql*

in *tourn_xtra.py*, the function `playGames()`:
- first checks for an odd number of pairs
- if the odd, i.e. last place, player already has a bye, player is swapped with the next lowest
ranking player without a bye.
- pairing with byes are generated by python code, not in psql views.
- byes are tracked in player table in tournamnet DB
